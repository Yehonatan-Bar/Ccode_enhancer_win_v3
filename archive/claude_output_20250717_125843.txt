Prompt: [CRITICAL] Verify all imports and dependencies exist and are properly configured. Check that the code can actually run without missing modules, undefined functions, or incompatible interfaces with existing code.User requested to add error handling to snake.py. I implemented comprehensive error handling

All dependencies and configurations verified successfully. Key fixes made:

1. **Added pygame==2.5.2 to requirements.txt** - This was missing and required for the game to run
2. **Removed unused datetime import** - Cleaned up unnecessary import from snake.py:7
3. **Syntax validation passed** - Code compiles without errors
4. **Logging configuration confirmed working** - Creates logs directory and app.log file properly

The error handling implementation is comprehensive and all imports/dependencies are now properly configured. The code can run without missing modules or undefined functions.
