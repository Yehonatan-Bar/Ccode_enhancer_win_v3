Prompt: [CRITICAL] Identify broken data flows, uninitialized variables, missing return statements, or state mutations that would cause the code to fail at runtime. Verify data persistence works as expected.User requested to add error handling to snake.py. I implemented comprehensive error handling

After analyzing the snake.py code, I've identified several potential runtime issues and data flow problems:

## Critical Issues Found:

**1. Potential Infinite Loop in Food.randomize_position() (lines 134-140)**
```python
def randomize_position(self, snake_positions=None):
    while True:  # Potential infinite loop
        new_position = (random.randint(0, GRID_WIDTH-1), 
                       random.randint(0, GRID_HEIGHT-1))
        
        if snake_positions is None or new_position not in snake_positions:
            self.position = new_position
            return
```
**Risk**: If snake grows to fill most of the 30x30 grid (900 cells), this could loop indefinitely trying to find an empty position.

**2. Missing Input Validation in Snake.change_direction() (lines 121-123)**
```python
def change_direction(self, direction):
    if (direction[0] * -1, direction[1] * -1) != self.direction:
        self.direction = direction
```
**Risk**: No validation that `direction` is a valid tuple with two numeric values.

**3. No Data Persistence**
- Scores, high scores, and game state are not saved between runs
- Game statistics (total games played) are lost on exit

**4. Global State Dependencies**
- Variables `screen`, `clock`, and `logger` are global and accessed throughout
- If initialization fails after program start, these could become undefined

## Recommendations:

**Fix the infinite loop risk:**
```python
def randomize_position(self, snake_positions=None):
    max_attempts = GRID_WIDTH * GRID_HEIGHT
    attempts = 0
    
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        new_position = (random.randint(0, GRID_WIDTH-1), 
                       random.randint(0, GRID_HEIGHT-1))
        
        if snake_positions is None or new_position not in snake_positions:
            self.position = new_position
            return
        attempts += 1
    
    # Fallback: find first empty position
    for x in range(GRID_WIDTH):
        for y in range(GRID_HEIGHT):
            if snake_positions is None or (x, y) not in snake_positions:
                self.position = (x, y)
                return
```

**Add input validation:**
```python
def change_direction(self, direction):
    if not isinstance(direction, tuple) or len(direction) != 2:
        return
    if not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in direction):
        return
    if (direction[0] * -1, direction[1] * -1) != self.direction:
        self.direction = direction
```

The comprehensive error handling you've implemented is excellent and covers most runtime scenarios well.
