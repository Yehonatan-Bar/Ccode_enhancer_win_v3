Prompt: [CRITICAL] Identify broken data flows, uninitialized variables, missing return statements, or state mutations that would cause the code to fail at runtime. Verify data persistence works as expected.

[STANDARD] Review state management consistency, data transformations, and flow between components. Ensure proper handling of async operations, callbacks, and promises. Check that data maintains integrity throughout its lifecycle.User requested to add 1 error handling to snake.py. I implemented comprehensive error handling for pygame rendering operations in the main game loop. Modified files: snake.py (added try-except blocks around screen.fill(), snake drawing operations, food drawing operations, pygame.display.flip(), and clock.tick(). Also added display reinitialization logic for recovery from critical rendering errors)

## Critical Issues Found

**1. Global Screen Variable State Mutation (snake.py:292)**
- The `screen` variable is reassigned within the display recovery error handler but relies on global state
- If display reinitialization fails, the global `screen` could be in an undefined state
- This could cause subsequent rendering operations to fail

**2. Data Flow Inconsistency in Food Class (snake.py:118-123)**
- `food.position` can be set to `None` when no free position is found (line 119)
- Error fallback sets `food.position = (0, 0)` without checking if position is occupied by snake
- This creates inconsistent data flow where food might overlap with snake

**3. Incomplete Error Recovery Path (snake.py:296-298)**
- When display reinitialization fails, both `running` and `play_again` are set to `False`
- However, the code continues to execute the remaining game loop iteration
- This can cause operations on an invalid `screen` object

**4. Missing Return Statement in Game Over Screen (snake.py:154)**
- The `game_over_screen` function has an infinite loop that only exits through explicit returns
- If neither SPACE nor ESC is pressed and the window isn't closed, the function never returns
- This could cause the game to hang indefinitely

**5. Unhandled State in Clock Error Recovery (snake.py:305-306)**
- Clock tick errors are logged but game continues without proper frame rate limiting
- This can cause the game to run at maximum CPU speed, potentially causing performance issues

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix global screen state mutation:**
```python
# In main() function, ensure screen is properly reinitialized
if screen is None:
    try:
        screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")
    except:
        return  # Exit if display cannot be recovered
```

2. **Fix food position data flow:**
```python
# In Food.randomize_position, ensure consistent fallback
if attempts >= max_attempts:
    # Find any free position, even if suboptimal
    for x in range(GRID_WIDTH):
        for y in range(GRID_HEIGHT):
            if (x, y) not in (snake_positions or []):
                self.position = (x, y)
                return
    self.position = None  # Game board truly full
```

3. **Add proper return statement for game_over_screen:**
```python
def game_over_screen(screen, score):
    # Add timeout or default behavior
    return False  # Add at end of function
```

The error handling implementation addresses rendering failures but introduces potential state inconsistencies that could cause runtime failures.
