Prompt: lOkk at my snake game, is it safe to run?
================================================================================

Yes, your snake game is safe to run. The code is clean and contains only standard game functionality:

**Safe elements:**
- Uses legitimate `pygame` library for graphics
- Standard game mechanics (snake movement, food spawning, collision detection)
- No network connections or file operations
- No system calls or dangerous imports
- Clean exit handling with `pygame.quit()` and `sys.exit()`

**Security analysis:**
- No malicious code patterns detected
- Only imports `pygame`, `random`, and `sys` (all safe)
- No file I/O operations
- No subprocess calls or shell commands
- No network requests

The game is a straightforward implementation of the classic Snake game with proper bounds checking and collision detection. It's safe to run on your system.
