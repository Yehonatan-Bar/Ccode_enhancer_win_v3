Prompt: Review the changes I made and tell me whether I handled all error scenarios at the highest standard. If not, what should be improved?

================================================================================

Good error handling improvements! However, several critical scenarios are missing:

**Missing Error Scenarios:**
1. **Food fallback failure**: Line 86-91 doesn't handle the case where ALL grid positions are occupied by snake (impossible to place food)
2. **Clock initialization**: Line 33 lacks error handling for `pygame.time.Clock()`
3. **Event processing**: Lines 134-146 don't handle potential pygame event errors
4. **Drawing operations**: Lines 158-174 pygame.draw calls aren't wrapped in try-catch
5. **Screen display**: Line 173 `pygame.display.flip()` could fail

**Additional Issues:**
- Line 108: `pygame.display.flip()` in game_over_screen isn't error-handled
- Line 194: Empty except clause could mask important errors
- No validation for grid dimensions (WIDTH/HEIGHT could be invalid)

**Recommendations:**
- Add try-catch around all pygame drawing operations
- Handle the theoretical case where no food position exists
- Replace bare `except:` with specific exception handling
- Add validation for game constants
- Consider adding timeout to event loops to prevent infinite blocking

Your foundation is solid with logging and graceful exits, but these additions would achieve the highest error handling standard.
