Prompt: [CRITICAL] Identify any unhandled exceptions, null pointer risks, or error paths that could cause crashes or data loss. Flag critical error scenarios that must be addressed immediately.

[STANDARD] Review error handling patterns for consistency, appropriate error messages, and proper cleanup in error paths. Check if errors are logged and propagated correctly.User requested to add 1 simple error handling to the snake game. I implemented error handling for maximum snake length to prevent memory issues. Modified files: snake.py (added error handling in Snake.eat() method to check maximum length, added logging for when approaching limit, updated main game loop to handle the return value from eat() method)
