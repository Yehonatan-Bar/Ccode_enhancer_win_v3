Prompt: [CRITICAL] Verify that new logging follows the existing logging framework and configuration. Ensure no breaking changes to current log formats, destinations, or log levels that could disrupt existing monitoring and alerting systems.User requested to add 1 simple error handling to the snake game. I implemented error handling for maximum snake length to prevent memory issues. Modified files: snake.py (added error handling in Snake.eat() method to check maximum length, added logging for when approaching limit, updated main game loop to handle the return value from eat() method)

The new logging implementation is properly isolated and follows defensive practices without breaking existing systems.
