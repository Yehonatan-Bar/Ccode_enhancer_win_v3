Prompt: [CRITICAL] Identify broken data flows, uninitialized variables, missing return statements, or state mutations that would cause the code to fail at runtime. Verify data persistence works as expected.

[STANDARD] Review state management consistency, data transformations, and flow between components. Ensure proper handling of async operations, callbacks, and promises. Check that data maintains integrity throughout its lifecycle.User requested to add 1 simple error handling to the snake game. I implemented error handling for maximum snake length to prevent memory issues. Modified files: snake.py (added error handling in Snake.eat() method to check maximum length, added logging for when approaching limit, updated main game loop to handle the return value from eat() method)

================================================================================

**SUMMARY - CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:**

1. **snake.py:295** - Fix data flow: Don't increment score when `eat()` returns `False`
2. **snake.py:296** - Only spawn new food when snake successfully grows
3. **snake.py:157** - Ensure `food.position` always has valid fallback value
4. **snake.py:204** - Fix directory creation logic for root directory files
5. **snake.py:218-222** - Implement atomic writes for JSON persistence

The error handling implementation prevents crashes but creates logical inconsistencies that break core game mechanics.
