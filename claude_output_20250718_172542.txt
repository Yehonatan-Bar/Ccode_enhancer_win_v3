Prompt: [CRITICAL] Identify any unhandled exceptions, null pointer risks, or error paths that could cause crashes or data loss. Flag critical error scenarios that must be addressed immediately.

[STANDARD] Review error handling patterns for consistency, appropriate error messages, and proper cleanup in error paths. Check if errors are logged and propagated correctly.User requested simple update to snake.py, implemented pause functionality using P key. Modified files: snake.py (added paused state variable, added P key handler to toggle pause, added pause display showing PAUSED text and instructions, prevented snake movement while paused, optimized frame rate when paused)
